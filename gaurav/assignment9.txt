Q 9.1 If <span> and <div> are semantically neutral (that is, they do not confer any meaning to the content they envelop), then why would you even use them? What possible benefit could we get from using these elements in our web page?
ANS: A span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.
