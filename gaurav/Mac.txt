The data link layer uses a physical address to identify a machine this address is called as MAC address.MAC Address stands for "Media Access Control" Address.
A MAC address is a hardware identification number that uniquely identifies each device on the network.MAC address is a 6 bytes(48 bites)physical address which is 
written in Hexadecimal format.
An Address can be three types
1]Unicast: Refers to only one computer in the LAN
2]Multicast:Refers to a group of address.This address can be destintion address but not a source address
3]Broadcast:Refers to all stations in the LAN.Iff all bites in the address is 1,it is broadcast address.
To identify the address is unicast or multicast,the LSB(least significant count)of the first byte is considered

The MAC method used by Ethernet is 1-persistent CSMA/CD.Means Machine sense the carrier before transmitting.If the medium is free,the machine transmits dat,If two 
or more machines transmit at the same time,there will be collision and abort the transmission.They retry after a random period.

How to find MAC address –
Command for UNIX/Linux -  ifconfig -a
                          ip link list 
                          ip address show

Command forWindows OS -   ipconfig /all 

MacOS -                   TCP/IP Control Panel


What are MAC addresses used for?
MAC addresses are the low level basics that make your ethernet based network work.
Network cards each have a unique MAC address. Packets that are sent on the ethernet are always coming from a MAC address and sent to a MAC address. 
If a network adapter is receiving a packet, it is comparing the packet’s destination MAC address to the adapter’s own MAC address. If the addresses match, the packet is
processed, otherwise it is discarded.
