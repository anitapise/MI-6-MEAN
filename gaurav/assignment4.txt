Q 4.1 Is there any best practice related to how often an H1 tag should ideally appear in a single web page? If so, what is the best practice?
->	keept H1 tag reserved for use only for heading in a web page. You can not use h1 tag again and again in one web page.

Q 4.2 Sometimes developers who do not understand best practices properly may simply use text of a larger font size to denote headings
      instead of using one of the H tags. While visually both may appear identical and a casual reader would not even know the difference, 
      such a lapse might cause problems in certain scenarios. Mention at least one scenario where such an incorrect design could create a problem.
->	Visual readers are able to identify headings by scanning pages for text of a larger size or a different color/font face. 
      	Blind users on a screen reader are not able to see these visual changes, so increasing the font size is not a sufficient cue.
	Instead, the headings must be semantically "tagged" so that a screen reader can both identify headings and provide a list as a page.
