Q 10.2 List three differences between block and inline elements.

1.Block-level elements begin on new lines.
2.Block-level elements may contain inline elements and (sometimes) other block-level elements.
3.Block level elements such as <p>, <div>, <section>, etc. expand to to fill all the horizontal space available.
Inline Elements
1.Inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow.
2.You can't put block elements inside inline elements but may contain only data and other inline elements.
3.Inline elements take up only the horizontal space that is required based on their contents and applied CSS rules (padding, margin, etc).
