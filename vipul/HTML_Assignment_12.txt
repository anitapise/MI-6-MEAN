Q 12.1 The purpose of the ‘action’ attribute of an HTML form is defined as: 
‘The action attribute defines the location (an URL) where the form's collected data should be sent.’

This question probably goes beyond what you have learned in this section. You may have to do a little bit of independent study and reasoning to answer this question.
-> Yes, we can use the URL of a simple HTML page as the value of the 'action' attribute of form. Because it specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted.The values will be sent to an absolute URL - points to another web site (like action="http://www.example.com/example.htm") or it can be a relative URL - points to a file within a web site (like action="example.htm").
