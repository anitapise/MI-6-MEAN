Q 1.1 What did you find most interesting about the history of HTML?
	the HyperText Markup Language was the brainchild of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. 
	In 1991 he wrote a document called “HTML Tags” in which he proposed fewer than two dozen elements that could be used for writing web pages.
	Sir Tim didn’t come up with the idea of using tags consisting of words between angle brackets; 
	those kinds of tags already existed in the SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) format. 
	Rather than inventing a new standard, Sir Tim saw the benefit of building on top of what already existed, a trend that can still be seen in the development of HTML5.
	The W3C was simultaneously working on two different, incompatible types of markup: XHTML 2 and HTML 5 (note the space before the letter five). 
	Meanwhile a separate organization, the WHATWG, was working on a specification called HTML5 (with no space) that would be used as a basis for one of the W3C specifications!
