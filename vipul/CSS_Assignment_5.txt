Q 5.1 Sometimes designers mention multiple font families in their styles (eg: font-family: arial, helvetica, serif). How does this help?
-> font-family: arial, helvetica, serif, will look for the Arial font first and, if the browser canâ€™t find it, it will search for Helvetica, and then a common serif font.

Q 5.2 Mention one place where you have noticed text decoration being used on websites. Also mention the purpose for which text decoration was used in that place.
-> I noticed text decoration on webiste www.https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/text/, where menu bar options available it contains text-decoration:underline is used on website to link to another webpage.

Q 5.3 Replace the rbg values in the styles shown below with an actual colour value, such as red, blue, green, yellow, etc, without changing the colour of the span.
-> Before 
<style>
        #s1{
                background:rgb(0,0,255);
        }
        #s2{
                background:rgb(0%,0%,100%);
        }
</style>


After
<style>
        #s1{
                background:blue;
        }
        #s2{
                background:blue;
        }
</style>
