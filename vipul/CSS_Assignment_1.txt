From its first creation, Lie went on to co-create CSS1, CSS2 and RFC 2318 versions with Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau. In its first decade of existence (1994 – 2004) CSS, in all its specifications, became an established web standard greatly influencing the look and accessibility of the world wide web as we know it today. CSS3 was issued in 1999.
