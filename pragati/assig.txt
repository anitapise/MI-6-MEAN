TCP:
TCP uses the client-server model of communication in which a user or machine (a client) is provided a service (like sending a webpage) by another computer (a server) in the network.

The transport layer itself, however, is stateful. It transmits a single message, and its connection remains in place until all the packets in a message have been received and reassembled at the destination.

TCP/IP is important because whole internet runs over it. This is the protocols using which 2 different network Elements communicate with each other. Without the TCP/IP the data communication and Internet or Inter-Networking of the devices is not possible. This model is based on the OSI model.

The Link Layer is the physical network equipment used to interconnect nodes and servers.
The Internet Layer connects hosts to one another across networks.
The Transport Layer resolves all host-to-host communication.
The Application Layer is utilized to ensure communication between applications on a network.

The TCP stack divides the file into data packets, numbers them and then forwards them individually to the IP layer for delivery. Although each packet in the transmission has the same source and destination IP address, packets may be sent along multiple routes.
