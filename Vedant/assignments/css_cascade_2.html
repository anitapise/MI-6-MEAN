</html>

the color of the paragraph will appear purple.<br>
this is because:<br>
    specicifity of p is lowest as there is only 1 element present<br>
    specicifity of div p is the geratest as it performs inline styling.<br>
    specicifity of id is in between as it only has 1 id refrence and 1 element.<br>
