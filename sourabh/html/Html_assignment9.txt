Q 9.1 If &lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are semantically neutral (that is, they do not confer any meaning to the
content they envelop), then why would you even use them? What possible benefit could we get
from using these elements in our web page?
   ANS:- <span> is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning.
         <div> is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example, imagine a shopping cart widget that you could choose to pull up at any point during your time on an e-commerce site.
