Q 5.1 Web browsers are just one of the ways of rendering HTML pages. HTML content can also be
read out by speech readers instead of being displayed visually. Based on what you have read in this
section, what – according to you – would be the difference in the way the following two lines of text
are read out:
1. You need to come here<i>right now</i>.
2. You need to come here<em>right now</em>.
  ANS:- <i> stands for italic while <em> stands for emphasis. While both are typically but not always styled to display as italic, <em> is used when you want to put more stress on a word or phrase.

Q 5.2 As the author of a web page, when would you use &lt;strong&gt; as opposed to &lt;em&gt;?
   ANS:- While <em> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), <strong> is used to give portions of a sentence added importance.
