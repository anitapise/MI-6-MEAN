Q 1.1 What did you find most interesting about the history of HTML?
HTML is the unifying language of the World Wide Web. Using just the simple tags it contains, the human race has created an astoundingly diverse network of hyperlinked documents, from Amazon, eBay, and Wikipedia, to personal blogs and websites dedicated to cats that look like Hitler
As with the web itself, the HyperText Markup Language was the brainchild of Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
In 1991 he wrote a document called “HTML Tags” in which he proposed fewer than two dozen elements that could be used for writing web pages
Sir Tim didn’t come up with the idea of using tags consisting of words between angle brackets; those kinds of tags already existed in the SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) format.
Rather than inventing a new standard, Sir Tim saw the benefit of building on top of what already existed, a trend that can still be seen in the development of HTML5.
The first official specification was HTML 2.0, published by the IETF, the Internet Engineering Task Force. Many of the features in this specification were driven by existing implementations.
the market-leading Mosaic web browser of 1994 already provided a way for authors to embed images in their documents using an <img> tag. The img element later appeared in the HTML 2.0 specification.
