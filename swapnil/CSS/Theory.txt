Q:What did you find most interesting about the history of CSS?
-"Cascading Style Sheets" wasn't the only proposed style language at the time. -CSS had one feature that distinguished it from all the others: it took into
 account that on the Web the style of a document couldn't be designed by either the author or the reader on their own, but that their wishes had to be
 combined, or "cascaded," in some way; and, in fact, not just the reader's and  the author's wishes, but also the capabilities of the display device and the
 browser. 

Q:Briefly describe any three things a developer can style with CSS.
1)Fonts properties.
 -font-style:Identifies the style of the face, normal, italic, or oblique.
 -font-variant:Identifies another variation on the face either normal or
  small-caps in CSS1.
 -font-size:The size of the face. Font size may be specified in absolute units   or relative to the "current" size.
 -font-weight:The weight or boldness of the font, specified with either a
   keyword (bold or bolder, for example) or as a member of the ordered series
   100, 200, 300, . . . , 900, where higher numbers are correspondingly darker.

2)Text properties (word spacing, letter spacing, etc.).
   -word-spacing:Modifies the default inter-word spacing.
   -letter-spacing:Modifies the default inter-letter spacing.
   -text-transform:Shifts text to uppercase or lowercase.
   -text-align:Specifies left, right, center, or justified alignment.

3)Boxes
  -margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right, margin
   Determine the size of the top, bottom, left, and right margins. Setting
   margin adjusts all of the margins simultaneously.

  -padding-top,padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right, padding
   Adjusts the amount of padding on the top, bottom, left, and right sides of
   the element. Setting padding adjusts all of them simultaneously.

  -width, height
   Identifies the width and height of the rectangle that contains the formatted   content. Images should be scaled to the specified size, if necessary.

  -float
   Identifies an element that should float to the left or right of a flow of
   text, allowing the text to flow around it.

Q:Using inline styles is considered to be horrible by most web designers.
  What is so bad about it?
  -It will messed with HTML.and also peoples who are stuck using older browsers   are having issue with using inline css.

Q:What are the benefits of using a linked stylesheet as compared to using
  embedded styles in the HTML page itself?
-Everything is stored within single page.
-once changed/updated, the changes are reflected on all other pages that
 reference the stylesheet.
-easier to maintain larger websites.

Q:The table below contains selector combinatory names in the first column and
  the way a selector combination is depicted in a style sheet, in the second.
  However, the values are mismatched. You have to re-create this table with the  correct matches.
  
  Combinator Name                   CSS syntax
  Descendant                        p ~ li {  } 
  Immediate descendant (child)      p + li {  }
  Sibling                           P > li {   }
  Adjacent sibling                  p  li {   }

- Combinator Name                   CSS syntax
  Descendant                        p  li {   }
  Immediate descendant (child)      P > li {   }
  Sibling                           p ~ li {  }
  Adjacent sibling                  p + li {  }

Q:Many web authors use a reset CSS. What problems might happen if they don’t
  use it?
-A CSS Reset (or “Reset CSS”) is a short, often compressed (minified) set of
 CSS rules that resets the styling of all HTML elements to a consistent
 baseline.this creates a certain amount of headaches for CSS authors, who can’t work out how to make their websites look the same in every browser.

Q:In which colour will the text “This is the first paragraph.” be printed for
  the HTML and CSS shown below? Also explain the specificity rule by which that  colour is chosen.
<html>
        <head>
                <style>
			div#section1 span{
                                             color:green
                   	}
			div p{
				color:blue
			}
			p{
			   color:red
			}
                </style>
        </head>
        <body>
                <div id="section1">
                        <p> this is first paragraph </p>
                </div>
        </body>
</html>

-Blue color there is no selector of span tag.div p<immediate parent> so it will execute first.

Q:In which colour will the text “This is a heading!” be printed for the HTML
  and CSS shown below? Also explain the specificity rule by which that colour
  is chosen.
<html>
        <head>
                <style>
			#parent{
        			 color:green;
			}
			h2{
        		    color:purple;
			}
                </style>
        </head>
        <body>
                <div id="parent">
                        <h2>This is heading!</h2>
                </div>
        </body>
</html>

-It will in purple color.
-id=parent is div id.
-According to rule <h2> is first priority.

Q:Sometimes designers mention multiple font families in their styles
  (eg: font-family: arial, helvetica, serif). How does this help?
-It will look first for arial font.if it not found by browser then it will
 helvetica and then serif.

Q:Mention one place where you have noticed text decoration being used on
  websites. Also mention the purpose for which text decoration was used in that  place.
-http://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/text/ where menu bar options
 contains text-decoration:underline is used.

Q:Replace the rbg values in the styles shown below with an actual colour value, such as red, blue, green, yellow, etc, without changing the colour of the span

<html>
        <head>
                <style>
			#s1{
       			     background:rgb(0,0,255);
			}
			#s2{
       			    background:rgb(0%,0%,100%);
		   	}
                </style>
        </head>
        <body>
                <span id="s1"> Amber Academy </span>
                <span id="s2"> Amber Academy </span>
        </body>
</html>

-<html>
        <head>
                <style>
			#s1{
        		    background:red;
   			}
			#s2{
        		    background:green;
   			}
                </style>
        </head>
        <body>
                <span id="s1"> Amber Academy </span>
                <span id="s2"> Amber Academy </span>
        </body>
</html>

Q:Show with the help of a proper box diagram, the difference in the way the
  span element (with id=s1) will be rendered in both the scenarios shown below:
Scenario A

<html>
        <head>
                <style>
			#s1{
       			     margin-left:20px;
      		   	     background:yellow;
			}
                </style>
                <body>
                        <span id="s1"> Amber Academy </span>
                </body>
</html>

Scenario B

<html>
        <head>
                <style>
			#s1{
       			    padding-left:20px;
       		   	    background:yellow;
			}
                </style>
                <body>
                        <span id="s1"> Amber Academy </span>
                </body>
</html>

-In Scenario A the text Amber Academy will display with color.keeping margin
 left20px.In Scenario B first color dispalys in color it keeps padding 20px 
 and then text displays in it.

Q:What is the difference between display:block and display:block-inline
-display:block
 It has height,width and margin.

-display:block-inline
 It has margin,padding,height and width.

Q:What is the purpose of using ‘clear’ after floating elements?
-The clear property is directly related to the float property. It specifies if  an element should be next to the floated elements or if it should move below
 them. This property applies to both floated and non-floated elements. If an
 element can fit in the horizontal space next to the floated elements, it will.

Q:Mention two ways in which we can apply properties to an element so that it is taken out of the normal flow.
-1)position:absolute;
 2)position:relative;

Q: List at least two advantages of using well known best practices for CSS.
-1)Lightweight code.
 2)Greater accessibility.
