Q:Sometimes developers who do not understand best practices properly may simply  use text of a larger font size to denote headings instead of using one of the  H tags. While visually both may appear identical and a casual reader would
  not even know the difference, such a lapse might cause problems in certain
  scenarios. Mention at least one scenario where such an incorrect design could  create a problem.

  problem.
