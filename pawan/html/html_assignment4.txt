Q 4.1 Is there any best practice related to how often an H1 tag should ideally appear in a single web page? If so, what is the best practice?
	answer:-if we try to use so many h1 tags it will not look good so ther are some differnt tags along with h1 such as h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 

Q 4.2 Sometimes developers who do not understand best practices properly may simply use text of a larger font size to denote headings instead of using one of the H tags. While visually both may appear identical and a casual reader would not even know the difference, such a lapse might cause problems in certain scenarios. Mention at least one scenario where such an incorrect design could create a problem.
	answer:-A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces. Heading information may be used by user agents, for example, to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.There are six levels of headings in HTML with H1 as the most important and H6 as the least. Visual browsers usually render more important headings in larger fonts than less important ones.
